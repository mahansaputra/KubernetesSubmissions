With GitOps we achieve the following:

    Better security
        Nobody needs access to the cluster, not even CI/CD services. No need to share access to the cluster with collaborators; they will commit changes like everyone else.
    Better transparency
        Everything is declared in the GitHub repository. When a new person joins the team, he/she can check the repository; no need to pass ancient knowledge or hidden techniques as there are none.
    Better traceability
        All changes to the cluster are version controlled. You will know exactly what was the state of the cluster and how it was changed and by whom.
    Risk reduction
        If something breaks simply revert the cluster to a working commit. git revert and the whole cluster is in a previous state.
    Portability
        Want to change to a new provider? Spin up a cluster and point it to the same repository - your cluster is now there.
